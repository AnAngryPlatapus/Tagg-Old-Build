# Tagg-Old-Build

Showcase of an older build of the Tagg client react-native application.  Although the code is crude and I would not do things this way again with what I know now, the app consists entirely of code I wrote.  This version was to showcase working authentication using JWT.  A more fleshed out UI build exists but still needs to be found.
